## Project Overview
We have provided all our code and models within a single, comprehensive Jupyter Notebook file: `DataScience.ipynb`. This notebook is a collectionof code and showcases the entire process, including:
- **Data Preparation**: Loading, cleaning, and preprocessing data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis and visualization (differentiation of sites, kpis, clustering).
- **Data Prediction**: Building and evaluating predictive models.

The notebook is designed for easy navigation, providing some explanations and visual outputs at each stage.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook and replicate our results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zeyd263/DataDynamos.git
   cd DataDynamos
   ```

2. Ensure you have `conda` installed on your system to manage dependencies.

---

## Environment Setup
We have included an environment file (`environment.yml`) to simplify dependency management. This file ensures that all necessary packages are correctly installed.

### Steps to set up the environment:

1. Create and activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate Dynamos
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DataScience.ipynb
   ```

This will load the environment `Dynamos` with all required dependencies.
